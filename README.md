This git repository contains dummy data of Health care providers/Prescribers along with the claims made via them to client pharmacy. The MySQL queries are used to identify the Prescibers who have shown increase or decrease in the script volumes for client pharmacy. The queries compare the Presciber ID with existing data to target newly added prescribers. Thus SQL queries are developed to target specific prescibers for maximizing sales.
